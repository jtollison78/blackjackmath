This is an initial release of my blackjack math code for infinite deck calculations, usually mutal recursion. It's the only codebase I'm aware of that does this and is meant for more than demonstration purposes. The tradeoff in favor of expressiveness and usability is well worth it imo!

There's a known logic error that needs reworking in split. It's splitting to 8 hands, not 5. Fixing this is a priority for me.

Otherwise, I'm releasing the code with the loose intentions of following with better documentation and instructional material, as well as my code for finite decks (already written).
